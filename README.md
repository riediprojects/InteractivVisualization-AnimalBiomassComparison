# Interactiv Visualization Project: Global biomass comparison between farm animals, humans and wild animals

## Aim
The aim is to create an interactive information visualization project based on a large amount of data.

## Idee
The population of humans and the number of farm animals continues to grow worldwide inexorably. 
A statistic will show how much biomass these life forms have together in order to compare them with the biomass of all wild mammals in the world. 
The biomass is calculated per human, asses, buffalo, cattle, goats, horses, mules, pigs, sheep, turkeys and chicken for each year since 1960. These figures can then with increasing years be compared in detail with the biomass of the wild animals.

## Why I chose this project
A well-known doctor mentioned that the biomass of all wild animals is much smaller than the biomass of all farm animals in the world. This statement touched me very much, which is why I decided to bring the message of this fact to the people by implementing this in a interactiv visualisation project.

## Why I chose Bubbles
The aim was to present the data in such a way that one can see as clearly as possible the proportion of quantities between the categories. In principle, a pie chart, for example, would be well suited for this purpose. However, I wanted to implement something more striking with my project. Something that would make the fact of this excessive keeping of farm animals a lasting effect on the visitors.
That's why I chose bubbles to display the data. Bubbles are also good for displaying proportions. Especially can they be used to achieve good results in terms of gamification, because they encourage playing around. For this reason, I added some functions to play around with the bubbles and so the core message of the project is better remembered.
